Please answer each of the following questions with either 'Y' for Yes or 'N' for No, and match your answers with the corresponding question ID.\nCan you identify the main functions in the code? (YN)\nIs this code a network-related program? (YN)\nDo you think the code is scalable? (YN)\nDoes the code make calls to suspicious or potentially harmful APIs, such as those related to keyboard logging, screen capturing, or modifying system files? (YN)\nDoes the code establish network connections or send data over the network without user consent? (YN)\nAre there routines for encrypting files or data that seem unrelated to the program's core functionality? (YN)\nDoes the code attempt to hide its presence or activity, such as disguising its processes or modifying log files? (YN)\nAre there mechanisms ensuring the code executes on system startup or remains active in the background? (YN)\nHere is the code snippet:\n{code}\nI need the answers in a concise format, with each response directly corresponding to the question number.\nJust return Y or N in front of each question ID, without any extra word!!"""
